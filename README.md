# Solidifront Themes

The easiest way to create a fully customize-able theme. Provides a similar dx to Shopify's liquid themes.

_Will be for specific as the idea becomes more flushed out :)_

## Todo:

- [ ] Create the ability to define templates, sections, blocks, and global theme settings.
- [ ] Create the ability to attach these "templates" to collections, products, pages, blogs and articles
- [ ] Create the functionality needed to render the correct template based off of the url using Solid Start.
- [ ] Create an admin UI to be able to manage the content of a template.
  - [ ] Add and remove sections
  - [ ] Add blocks to sections
  - [ ] Modify global theme settings

_This project is created specifically for the Solid Hackathon: 10/01/2024 - 11/14/2024_
